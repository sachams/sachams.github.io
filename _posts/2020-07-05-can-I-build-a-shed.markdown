Our last shed was of the B&Q flatpack variety. It had done fairly well - it had been around for about 8 years but eventually it had started to rot from the bottom up. It was a bit on the small side too, and getting anything out involved unpacking half the shed first. It was time for a new shed. I was keen on something with a bit more longevity than a typical flatpack shed, as well as something that would fit the family's bikes.

I'd recently built a new side return gate and a little shelter for the wheelie bins and reckoned I could probably put together a shed from scratch. As a Christmas present my partner bought me a [4 day carpentry course at The Builder Training Centre](https://thebtc.co.uk/brochure/foundation-carpentry-courses/) in Croydon (it was great).

Armed with some basic carpentry skills from the course and some tips from the instuctor, I started planning the shed. The planning was probably the stage that took the longest time.
