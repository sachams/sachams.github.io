This is a sample post to demonstrate how to embed an ObservableHQ notebook into a web page using an iframe.

Here is the embed code:

```html
<iframe width="100%" height="1728" frameborder="0"
  src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@airaware/breathelondon-node-data@900?cells=viewof+nodeSearch%2Cviewof+selectedNode%2Cviewof+startDate%2Cviewof+endDate%2Ccharts"></iframe>
```

And here is how it appears as an embed:

<iframe width="100%" height="1728" frameborder="0"
  src="https://observablehq.com/embed/@airaware/breathelondon-node-data@900?cells=viewof+nodeSearch%2Cviewof+selectedNode%2Cviewof+startDate%2Cviewof+endDate%2Ccharts"></iframe>
