For the past five years I have been giving a talk on my experiences living with Type 1 diabetes to students of the [Human Computer Interaction MSc](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/human-computer-interaction-msc) at the [UCL Interaction Centre](https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/), a department of University College London. 

It's something I really enjoy doing, and hopefully I can give the students some insights into things to consider when designing products and tools to help people who are living with chronic conditions. 

You can see this year's slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K4acLfQ4wdhlUXyyypdcARdLC6KvVSZfRu34Eu3zEQM/edit?usp=sharing).
