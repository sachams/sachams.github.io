One part of The Glucose Project is to try and quantify exercise so that it can be correlated with insulin usage and blood glucose level. The question I want to answer is, depending on the amount of exercise I have done, how should I adjust my insulin dose?

My first approach is to look at heart rate data logged during exercise and somehow quantify it. There are a number of methods of doing this, most falling under the banner of TRIMP (TRaining IMpulse). [This site](http://fellrnr.com/wiki/TRIMP) has a nice summary of popular methods. Iâ€™m going to use two methods â€“ total duration and TRIMP exp (i.e., exponentially weighted heart rate times duration).

To do this I need to capture my heart rate. A bit of Googling revealed the following options:

|OPTION|PROS|CONS|
|[Basis B1 watch](http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/07/basis-b1-review.html)|Logs heart rate 24Ã—7 as well as a lot of other metrics|Doesnâ€™t work very well when exercising; data is hard to extract for offline analysis|
|[Mio Alpha](http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/02/monitor-bluetooth-smartant.html)|Works while exercising; is ANT+ compatible so can replace any other HRM sensor so you can upload your workouts directly to (e.g.) Strava|Doesnâ€™t do 24Ã—7 monitoring|
|[True Sense](http://op-innovations.com/en/TSKdesc)|Small; low-cost; looks very interesting; not 24Ã—7 but with two of them you could get continuous coverage|Fairly experimental â€“ would need a lot of work to productionise|
|[Actiheart](http://www.camntech.com/products/actiheart/actiheart-overview)|Looks really cool â€“ just the ticket|Very expensive (>$1500)|
|[BioPatch](http://www.zephyranywhere.com/products/biopatch/) and [BioHarness](http://www.zephyranywhere.com/products/bioharness-3/)|Also looks pretty awesome|Also very expensive ðŸ˜¦|
|[Garmin ANT+ heart rate strap](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0029M3NSS/dcraicom-21)|Cheap, reliable|Not 24Ã—7|

Iâ€™m going to start by using the Garmin HRM strap â€“ Iâ€™ve got one already and it works pretty well. Although it isnâ€™t 24Ã—7, itâ€™s only really the periods of exercise that I am interested in, so this should be sufficient to investigate correlation of exercise and insulin usage. Iâ€™d love to come back later and investigate the True Sense products as they look really interesting.

Next job is to look at how to analyse the heart rate data.
